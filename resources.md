[Machine Learning Zero to Hero (Google I/O'19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwVg9jCtqaU)

### Other resources:

The [TensorFlow Tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) are great, come with jupyter/colab notebooks; you will recognize a some of the code.

The [Kaggle learning center](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview) is great.

The [scikit-learn Tutorials](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html) page is good, and all of [scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) is amazing.

The [NLTK manual](https://www.nltk.org/book/) is a good intro to NLP. After that, the [Spacy 101](https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101) is a good follow up.

The [Pandas manual](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) is a good resource. [10 min to Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html) is a good start.
