But is it really as magnificent as suggested? True, you can get a massage, the rooms have flat screen T.V.s and iPod docks, heck, there's even a gym. But the truth is, you're really paying much more for a few things you don't really need. The Swissotel attempts to lure you in with their illusions of grandeur, when really, all you're getting is a Holiday Inn style room with fancy wallpaper and the ability to play tunes from your mp3 player. Overpriced dining options are available at the Palm Restaurant. They claim to serve excellent lobster, yet what I ordered was the size of a craw fish, and left the taste of a burnt fifty dollar bill in my mouth. This hotel hides behind a velvet curtain, hoping their facade won't be revealed.\\n\"\n","review 2\n","b\"Sometimes you just can't find fault with a hotel, even if you tried. Such was the case with Sofitel, where we'd never stayed before. It's a sleek, modern, sophisticated hotel with European touches. We spent three days there on a leisure weekend, we had a 29th floor king room looking directly at the Hancock Building, at a total cost including taxes and lugs of about $165 a night. The room was average sized, well-appointed, everything in it worked, and it had a fabulous view of the Chicago high-rise jungle, including snippets of the lake. The public areas were wonderfully decorated. The restaurant served a good breakfast at, for Chicago, reasonable prices. The staff was excellent. My wife broke her ankle several weeks before we visited and was on crutches. The staff loaned us a wheelchair and was very helpful in assisting her. \\n\"\n","review 3\n","b'My family and I stayed here while we were visiting Chicago. This was a perfect location to many of the things we wanted to do and was easy to get around. It was in a safe neighborhood and was great accomodations. The staff was friendly and went the \"extra mile\" to make sure we had everything we needed. The beds were comfortable. We would definitely stay here again. \\n'\n","review 4\n","b'The Ambassador East Hotel is a pretty girl with a bad heart. As i was staying for a few nights I notied may problems with the service of this expensive,cold hotel.First the room sevice was poorly helpful, the bag boy insisted on a tip, and also droped my bag. The chefs cooking was terriable,the steak that I spent 35 dollars on was suppost to be rare, but came to me burnt. The room was not what you pay for, the beds were like a sack of rocks. And to top it off the covers smelled like smoke. I will never give the Ambassador East Hotel another chance.\\n'\n","review 5\n","b'We stayed in the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago in a standard guest room. The rooms had just been renovated, but the changes did not make much of a difference. The room was so small, it felt like we were sleeping below deck on a boat. The decor was drab and there was nothing special about the room. We were excited about the bathrobe and slippers that came with the room, but we assumed there would be a bathrobe and a pair of slippers for each of us; there was only one bathrobe and one pair of slippers. We called the front desk to ask for a second set and were treated like we were trying to scam the hotel and refused to send them. It would not have mattered if they sent a second set; the bathrobe was so scratchy it gave me a rash and there were stains on the slippers. As hotel guests, we expected to be treated with respect and enjoy the stay we paid for. We were severely disappointed.\\n'\n","review 6\n","b\"During my stay at the Hilton Chicago it has been quite unpleasant. How so you might ask? Well ill tell you, the towels where scratchy and the service was terrible and by terrible I mean they weren't even at the desk when I checked in. Also, When I ordered my breakfast, lunch, and dinner from room service I received the wrong order for all meals and felt a little sick after lunch. Finally, The bill was charging me for stuff I didn't want or ask for. But overall the hotel was very bad and unpleasant for me and others. I give it a half a star.\\n\"\n","review 7\n","b'WARNING: FOOD POISONING ALERT!!! The room was dirty, the shower had mold and the handle in the shower my daughter cracked her head open on. The elevators were absolutly terrible they made me dizzy every time i went on it. They hade pasta night and they put out a bowl of noodles and sauce and i couple of rolls well you get what you pay for. What was worse is the sauce must of had bad meat in it because my family got so sick. The one thing that was nice was the location which was right by michigan avenue. The second night we left and went to another hotel which was 80 bucks cheaper and 100 times nicer. DO NOT STAY HERE\\n'\n","review 8\n","b\"This lovely hotel has only six floors, making it easy to get to elevators and down to reception. The building is dwarfed amongst all the skyscrapers around it. Trump's huge new tower is just down the street. The Amalfi looks recently refurbished, very modern, but warm and inviting. Bedrooms quite spacious with lovely linens and very, very comfortable beds. Bathroom quite small but roomy enough, with Aveda tolietries and constant hot water in the showers. Continental style breakfast is set out fresh every morning in front of the elevator of every floor. Great to stumble out of bed and grab a coffee etc (robes & slippers provided) without having to get dressed for a formal breakfast. Really enjoyed the Managers evening cocktail reception, especially the Amalfitinis. A nice way to relax after a hard days' shopping! Location is great for all the shops, transport, museums etc. Easy walking to everywhere. Staff also very friendly and welcoming. Would definately stay there again. \\n\"\n","review 9\n","b'My husband and I made a reservation at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers, for a much needed weekend getaway. We took off work early Friday to beat traffic. Once at the hotel we quickly found out that there was not ample parking. We drove around several times looking for a space and had to park in an adjoining lot and walk across a busy side street to gain access to the hotel. Upon checking in we were informed that the floor, where our room was located, was in the process of having the carpets cleaned. We decided since we prepaid with our credit card that we were going to make the best of the situation. We took the elevator, which smelled like urine, up to our room. We did see some carpet cleaning machines, unattended, in the hallway. I hoped for the sake of safety, no children were staying on this floor. We walked into our room and my first thought was how much humidity was in the room and it seems one of the guest used the microwave to heat up some sort of spicy curry cusine. The overwhelming scent of burnt curry mixed with the chemical smell of the carpet shampoo were too much for us. We called the desk manager and asked if we could change rooms. He rudely informed us that the hotel was completely booked due to several weddings. Just then, the roar of the carpet cleaning machine came through the walls and I could not hear anything else my husband said. We decided to get a refund on our card and leave the hotel. It was an awful experience.\\n'\n","true or false?\n","...\n","review 0 True\n","review 1 False\n","review 2 True\n","review 3 False\n","review 4 False\n","review 5 False\n","review 6 False\n","review 7 True\n","review 8 True\n","review 9 False\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"UasSIivKwjtU","colab_type":"code","outputId":"ff33f89b-eecd-458f-b526-c3d64b7070fd","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1573140558864,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":11261,"user":{"displayName":"Alessandro Pedori","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBZ_QXse8X3tRezZL0S4NOPVCPk_yWFQK_TNyprXA=s64","userId":"12717156193525782223"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34}},"source":["misclassified =  []\n","for i, item in enumerate(target):\n","    if item != results_c[i]:\n","        misclassified.append((data[i], item))\n","len(misclassified)"],"execution_count":49,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["91"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":49}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"UYHr9bZmwjtY","colab_type":"code","outputId":"cf24415c-26d2-4b72-b13e-7070e91fb4e1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1573140558864,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":11250,"user":{"displayName":"Alessandro Pedori","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBZ_QXse8X3tRezZL0S4NOPVCPk_yWFQK_TNyprXA=s64","userId":"12717156193525782223"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":377}},"source":["misclassified[:10]"],"execution_count":50,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[(b\"This hotel had a great location, but you can do much better for the money.

The friendliest people on the staff were the bell boys. They greeted us with a smile and gave us lots of great advice throughout our stay. The rest of the staff however was terrible. When we first checked in, I was instantly discouraged. The front desk person was not in a good mood and I couldn't wait to leave the lobby. Having not traveled here before we were looking for exciting places to eat and to go sightseeing. We asked multiple staff members at the front desk of places to go and see and never got any good recommendations. We felt as if we were an inconvenience to the staff. At one point, the front desk person was on the phone while we were waiting to talk to her, as she was on the phone a family of four came up behind us waiting to talk to her as well. Even though she saw us standing there, after she finished with the phone call she ignored us and helped the family first. Yes, we are in our mid 20's, but we are still paying guests and there is no reason to be treated like we are invisible. For how much money we paid for each night, I would have rather stayed somewhere else. We decided to go with this hotel because of the location and the great reviews, but we did not experience any of this during our stay. The rooms were alright, but nothing special. I would not stay in this hotel again.\\n\",\n","  1),\n"," (b\"Grant it, this hotel seems very nice, but I was not at all pleased with my stay here. The customer service was horrible. I had to request more towels and washcloths several times before receiving them and my linen had not been replaced either. For as much as I paid to stay here, you'd think the least you'd get is an iron. Not! I had to request an iron, too! In addition to all of the failed amenities, I was mistakenly charged twice for my stay and wasn't reimbursed until an entire week later. The next time I choose to visit Chicago, Swissotel will be the last place I think to stay.\\n\",\n","  0),\n"," (b'What a wonderful experience, super great, helpful, friendly staff.

I called the desk and asked for some and they said that I couldn't have any and that only the maid could come and set up the bed. My husband was ill and I wanted the bed set up so I wouldn't disturb him. but they were un moved and wouldn't bring the sheets. I ended up sleeping on the mattress with bath towels over it and another bath towel as a blanket.

We had a fantastic time and enjoyed every minute of our stay at this incredible hotel. The sheer size of the place is breathtaking and the atmosphere is very friendly and hospitable. If you prefer discreet modern boutiquey-type hotels, maybe this wouldn't be your thing. However if you enjoy old style glamour and glitz, you will be bowled over by this hotel. The place literally sparkles thanks to the enormous chandeliers that are everywhere in the lobby.

I was very disappointed in the level of service. 3 phone calls to get maintenance to fix the bathroom sink, unpleasant experience in the Terrace resturant, front desk not aware of room eminities, and a very uncaring MOD!

It was a hot summer day and I turned on the shower and only drips of hot water came out. I called to complain and they assured me that someone would be in my room to fix the shower or show me how to use it. I felt the person I spoke to was rude to me. They were not accepting responsibility, but talking down to me as if I was stupid. After waiting 30 minutes a bell hop came up to show me how to use the shower. This was not a service person. He could not get the shower to work either and apologized for the problem I was having. He expected a tip and complained when I did not give him one. Nobody came up after that. I was told I could switch to a different room, so I had to pack up my belongings and move to another floor. The shower did work in this other room, but I didn't have the view of the city that I had in the first room. I was looking at a brick wall. Plus there was a party in the next room that was so loud it kept me up all night. I complained and the hotel staff told me they were VIPs and could not do anything about the noise. This hotel was overpriced and my stay was miserable. Do not go to the Omni Hotel. I've stayed in $50 a night motels with better service.\\n\",\n","  0),\n"," (b\"My wife and I came to spend the weekend in downtown Chicago for shopping and we found this Conrad hotel well located close to everything downtown and of a size that doesn't make you feel lost in the Convention world.

Internet is free n the rooms and I am making my review from there. \\n\",\n","  1)]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":50}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"mEO2boaDwjtc","colab_type":"code","outputId":"e6c1d60b-6f37-43a4-8a45-5cdd6ad9a3e4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1573140558865,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":11243,"user":{"displayName":"Alessandro Pedori","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBZ_QXse8X3tRezZL0S4NOPVCPk_yWFQK_TNyprXA=s64","userId":"12717156193525782223"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":51}},"source":["from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\n","\n","confusion_matrix(target, results_c)"],"execution_count":51,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["array([[781,  20],\n","       [ 71, 728]])"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":51}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"G_O94_vV1qms","colab_type":"code","outputId":"8cd6c782-cf60-4272-8e6b-13331da40a04","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1573140559794,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":12164,"user":{"displayName":"Alessandro Pedori","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBZ_QXse8X3tRezZL0S4NOPVCPk_yWFQK_TNyprXA=s64","userId":"12717156193525782223"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":68}},"source":["nltk.download('punkt')"],"execution_count":52,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package punkt to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Unzipping tokenizers/punkt.zip.\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["True"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":52}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"RitWTJrCwjtg","colab_type":"code","outputId":"b6c12185-8f12-4477-aca2-ae2000e5cbd9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1573140566528,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":18889,"user":{"displayName":"Alessandro Pedori","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBZ_QXse8X3tRezZL0S4NOPVCPk_yWFQK_TNyprXA=s64","userId":"12717156193525782223"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":122}},"source":["%%time\n","\n","import string \n","\n","def stemming_tokenizer(text):\n","    stemmer = PorterStemmer()\n","    return [stemmer.stem(w) for w in word_tokenize(text)]\n"," \n","trial_stem = Pipeline([\n","    ('vectorizer', TfidfVectorizer(tokenizer=stemming_tokenizer,\n","                             stop_words=stopwords.words('english') + list(string.punctuation))),\n","    ('classifier', MultinomialNB(alpha=1)),\n","])\n","\n","train(trial_stem, data, target)\n"],"execution_count":53,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py:300: UserWarning: Your stop_words may be inconsistent with your preprocessing.

We had a big spacious room in the old tower. We avoided the expensive pitfalls of the hotel extras such as bottled water and items in the room fridge. The beds were great, the rooms were kept clean and the staff was very friendly. Great martinis in the hotel bar. I really can't understand the negative reviews. I know you can't please everyone, but in some cases I simply don't believe their claims. I've traveled a lot and have stayed in plenty of hotels.
