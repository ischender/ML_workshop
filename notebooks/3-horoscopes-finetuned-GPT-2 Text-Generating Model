You must learn to accept that life’s not always great and that, as long as you work alongside the people you love to, you will come through.\n","pisces:  The planets warn if you don’t act now they won’t act again after the Sun leaves your sign tomorrow – no matter how good your intentions may not be. This will be a busy time though, so get a full bladder and relax a bit.\n","pisces:  Some kind of financial plan will be key to your long-term financial prospects and the planets urge you to start making it a priority, now. Don’t leave yourself any more time or money on the table!\n","pisces:  There is no point trying to prove to other people what you know – you don’t have the power, of course, but what you know is important. The good news is no matter how strong the argument may be over the coming week it is probably best to ignore it.\n","pisces:  You are on the cusp of a major new phase and, even if you had not yet expected it, you know it is going to happen sooner or later. You have nothing to fear but everything to look forward to, so why worry?\n","pisces:  You need to get your act in gear, because once the Sun’s change of signs comes around the pace of affairs will pick up. What is your main goal, what is your long-term goal? Don’t worry too much about past accomplishments, focus on the future – and all the good things that come with it.\n","pisces:  There are very few things more important than your reputation, and what happens today will help to confirm that point. Even someone who is as big as you isn’t that big on the work front, so find ways to work alongside your more powerful partner.\n","pisces:  You will have to confront issues of this sort a lot during the early part of the week. Let others deal with them. In the longer-term they can learn from your example. No one is trying to steal your way to power.\n","pisces:  You may be on your own with money in the bank but there are some things you will have to work with friends to get some cash for. Make sure you have plenty of savings, then spend what you earn.\n","pisces:  The Sun’s change of signs tomorrow will in some way or other bring you the luck you always wanted. You are going to be a star if you put your mind to it. You will be a star when the Sun burns your brightest.\n","pisces:  The more others disagree with you now the more you will work together towards a mutually agreed upon solution, which you should expect will be far different from what happened yesterday and the day before. Think big and act big too.\n","pisces:  Don’t wait for the right people to speak your ear when the right people appear to be more than happy to listen. Also, try not to overreact. Sometimes the only way to get something done is to be there first and speak up – and that’s what’s happening.\n","pisces:  You have no intention of letting someone else take the lead. You will come into their life and make space for them in a way that feels good, but you don’t have to make it too big for your own good.\n","pisces:  You are not the kind to do anything for no reason – you want to be free to pursue your own interests. As a cosmic being you do have a duty to take care. Make sure a big part of your budget is spent on needs not luxuries.\n","pisces:  This is an important time for you – the planets indicate you will be forced to make a major choice in your career. Choose wisely – and you still have time to make another great big choice for yourself.\n","pisces:  You will be surrounded by great opportunities over the next few days – what can you do with them? You can and you must use it. Remember, just because others can do things for you does not mean you have to do them for them.\n","pisces:  You may seem to be a confident individual but the reality is you still fear the worst.

There is no point worrying about what other people think or say. It’s really all you can be concerned about.\n","aquarius:  If you are forced to take a vacation of some sort this weekend you will want to be somewhere other than where you are now. This is also a good time to make a new plan that you can be on for later on. Get on it and make the most of it. \n","aquarius:  Do something that takes place outside of yourself this week, something that will inspire you to keep pushing forward. You have been on such high energy lately that if you keep at it you will accomplish such a good deal.\n","aquarius:  By all means be flexible in recent weeks but now there is a clear opportunity, a clear need, a need with which to make a name for yourself, you must act immediately. Be careful what you say because others would not hesitate to make enemies out of people who don’t want the spotlight.\n","aquarius:  What has been worrying you for some time will start to fade and by the middle part of the week it will be back to your usual cheerful self again. Be on your guard today as others have been doing their bit to keep you on a tight leash. Be careful you don’t overdo it and get angry.\n","aquarius:  You may be a bit touchy about personal matters at the moment but the planets indicate there is precious little to worry about. No doubt about it you are being far too cautious, but there are no right or wrong ways to react. Let fate take it.\n","aquarius:  You are always on the lookout for opportunities, and if you are right this time will come. A little bit of thought and a little bit of self-belief would go a very long way in helping you to realize what you have been missing: a much bigger and better dream.\n","aquarius:  You may be more sensitive than usual to criticism of late, especially if it comes from someone who could, over the next 48 hours, actually make you look bad. Don’t let your temper show. It’s not worth the hassle, or to say the least it has no purpose.\n","aquarius:  Partnerships and social activities will enjoy the spotlight over the next few days. If you join forces with other people this weekend you will achieve something far larger in scope than you expected, no matter who you are or what it is you say.\n","aquarius:  As Mercury, your ruler, moves in your favor again in midweek the pressures and strains of everyday life, particularly on the work front, will ease a bit. Focus only on affairs of the heart now. You won’t be able to see your lover any more than you can see them from another angle.\n","aquarius:  You may not be much in the mood for work at the moment, no matter how many people say you are, but don’t let it worry you. You will be back to full speed once you have got things moving again. The Sun’s change of signs today will begin to bring your workload down.\n","aquarius:  You may have trouble saying “no” to someone who thinks you have a point of view that is critical of them, especially given you appear so relaxed about their views and activities. If you want to work out your differences you will have to say so – loudly, in fact.\n","aquarius:  Your body language is telling partners and colleagues you believe in them. In fact, if they had been thinking of changing or even leaving your world at that very moment they would have changed their minds. If you're smart they will be back again soon.\n","aquarius:  The Sun in your sign will bring partnership and collaboration issues to the fore.

Today’s Jupiter-Pluto link guarantees your ideas will come through and make your future look even prettier and better. Always look forward.\n","taurus:  Something will happen that makes you feel as if you don’t have the last resort. This is no time to despair, you will just have to cope and keep your emotions in check over the next 48 hours.

No one has the right to tell a colleague that their opinions are so wrong this week.\n","taurus:  The cosmic balance is tilted heavily in your favor, and with mind planet Mercury moving through your opposite sign you won’t hesitate to take advantage of its favorable influence.

Whatever you help others do for you, do it all for them.\n","taurus:  Be positive at all times and don’t let your negative vibes get under your skin. The fact is you are doing what you love and that is what matters most, so set your sights high and don’t look back to catch a falling-off. You never have to worry.\n","taurus:  Don’t worry too much about the details of your present situation. If what you are experiencing is of no concern to you then don’t make waves of it. The important thing is to find something comforting to say. It’s nothing more than a state of mind.\n","taurus:  A lot is going right for you now and good things will come your way over the next few days. You’re on the upswing of your life already, so forget your differences and accept each other as equals. It’s who you love that matters.\n","taurus:  Your head may be full of big ideas at the moment but don’t be so impulsive. Take your time with a task that demands your time and patience – the more time you have on your hands the more you will accomplish.\n","taurus:  Try not to be too impulsive or you could meet people you would not want to know if you were not on the move. It’s all good that you are taking life at so many different pace now but don’t go too fast.
